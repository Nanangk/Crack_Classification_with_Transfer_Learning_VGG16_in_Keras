# About The Project
TThis project aims to create a deep learning model for classification on crack patterns by implementing Transfer learning. The pre-trained model that we will use is VGG-16 which is a model that has been trained on ImageNet data but without a fully-connected layer and downloads its weights. All VGG-16 weights have been trained using the ImageNet dataset and can recognize colors, textures, etc. So we can use this to extract features from all the photos in our dataset.ansfer Learning implementation
